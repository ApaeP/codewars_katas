# Codewars - Kata Solution (Ruby)
# MAN IN THE WEST (8 kyu)

# Instructions
# A western man is trying to find gold in a river. To do that, he passes a bucket through the river's soil and then checks if it contains any gold. However, he could be more productive if he wrote an algorithm to do the job for him.
# So, you need to check if there is gold in the bucket, and if so, return True/true. If not, return False/false.

# Solution
def check_the_bucket(bucket)
  bucket.include?('gold')
end
