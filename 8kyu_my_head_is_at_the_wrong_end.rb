# Codewars - Kata Solution (Ruby)
# MY HEAD IS AT THE WRONG END (8 kyu)

# Instructions
# You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!
# Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).
# Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!

# Solution
def fix_the_meerkat(arr)
  arr.reverse
end
